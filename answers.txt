Q2: What field could data science be applied to? Give and Example and how it might help

Answer: Data science could be used in the healthcare field. For example, data scientists could analyze data about the health and wellness of a population, which could be used to track
the spread of illnesses in an area. This could help researchers potentially identify where a disease is spreading and how fast it is spreading. This information can be use to prevent
this disease from spreading in the future, as well as where it originated from. 


Q3: What is the difference between merging and rebasing?

Answer: Merging uses a merge commit to combine all the changes between two different branches. In this case, the histories from both branches are brought together and are still preserved 
after the merge is completed. However, merge can complicate the history of the project. A rebase makes new commits for each change made in an original branch, essentially changing the 
project history. This may be preferred because it can make the history of a project easier to follow.
